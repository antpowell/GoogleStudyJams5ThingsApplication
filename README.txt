This application hopes to display simple examples of 5 differnt ways applicaion makers can notify their users.


Intended for newer Android developers. Knowing and reading about differnt options and seeing them in action are two totally differnt things.
Hopfully this application could teach developers not only how the differnt ways of notifiying your users can look on screen but give them a good idea of what is possible and an idea of what will work well for their project. 
Android has different ways for apps to give you information or get your attention, and they all have different names. App developers need to know the differences, and when to use each one, so they can code the correct behaviour in their apps. Even as an end user, if you want to troubleshoot a problem, find which app is giving you messages, or describe some behaviour (for example, when reporting a bug to a developer), it saves you time and confusion if you can call each thing by its correct name.
